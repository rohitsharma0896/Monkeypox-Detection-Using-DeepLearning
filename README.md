# Monkeypox-Image-Classification-CNN
Monkeypox Detection Using Deep Learning
This repository contains a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for automated Monkeypox detection using skin lesion images. The project aims to assist early diagnosis by leveraging deep learning techniques to classify images as Monkeypox or Non-Monkeypox. Early detection is crucial for controlling outbreaks, and this model provides a fast, scalable, and cost-effective screening solution.

The notebook includes essential stages such as data preprocessing, visualization, augmentation, model building, performance evaluation, and prediction. The dataset comprises images of Monkeypox and other similar skin conditions, enabling the model to learn discriminative features effectively.

The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their strong capability in extracting visual patterns from medical images. Different architectures and hyperparameters were tested to achieve optimal accuracy. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are used to assess model performance, ensuring reliability in practical use cases.

The repository is beginner-friendly and well-documented, making it ideal for students, researchers, and healthcare-focused AI developers. Anyone can clone the notebook, experiment with the model, or extend it using transfer learning architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, or EfficientNet.

This project highlights how AI can support public health systems by providing rapid preliminary screening before medical consultation. It can be integrated into mobile health apps, telemedicine workflows, or hospital triage systems.
